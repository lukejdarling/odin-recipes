<div class="intro">As a late-night snack, a light supper or even a quick snack, beans on toast makes an ideal comforting meal when what you need is something warm in your stomach</div>
<div class="base">One of the big money savers comes from using a bag of dried beans; this also ensures that the beans have the right texture after several hours of simmering away. Soaking the beans does mean you need to plan ahead, but between the room in your wallet and the final result, you'll be glad you made the extra effort.</div>
<div class="base">This yields a good amount of food, even if you, like myself, need a nice big serving when eating beans for dinner. Even with a few big helpings for dinner you should still be able to have enough leftover to have a good fry up in the morning.</div>
