<h2>Huel is a complete food in a drink</h2>
<p>Huel can help you with weight management. But unlike diet shakes and simple protein powders, Huel is made with ingredients like oats, rice, peas, coconut and flaxseed. As in, real food. So you fuel your body with what it wants: a balanced macro-split featuring 26 essential vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>You could save five hours a week just by replacing your Monday-to-Friday lunches with Huel. No more meal prep. And no more sandwiches and crisps for lunch. Just keep Huel on your desk or in your car. Prep a Huel meal in minutes at lunch time. And get back to what you were doing.</p>
